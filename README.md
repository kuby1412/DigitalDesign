# Digital System Design

This repository consists of verilog codes for basic digital logics. All verilog files and testbench uploaded here.

This repo needs iverilog and gtkwave open-source EDA tools. With that said, it can also be run using commercial EDA tools
There is verilog file and an associated testbench tb_(verilog) file. The way to run the files are

```iverilog <verilog>.v tb_<verilog>.v```  // This will generate VCD file 
  
```gtkwave <verilog>.vcd``` // This command is used to view the waveforms
